# EasyNET

EasyNET is a TUI for developing .NET Core applications. It's built on Go and is also my first Go project and my first TUI project!!

Keep in mind that as of now (0.01) The app is not functional and should not be used.


## Features

- Panel based architecture (Heavily influenced by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit))
- Runs .NET SDK commands in the background to create controllers (TODO)
- Lightweight
